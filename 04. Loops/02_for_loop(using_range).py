# if we want to perform a task for a certain number of times, we can use range():

# Example: this below code, i iterates through 0,1,2,3,4,5 and every time during iteration prints the line
for i in range(6):
  print("Learning Loops!") #prints Learning Loops x 6

# Example: 

# print the below variable 5 times using a for loop:

promise = "I will finish the python loops module!"

for i in range(5):
  print(promise)

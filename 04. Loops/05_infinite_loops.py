# a loop that never terminates is infinite loop

# Example: 

students_period_A = ["Alex", "Briana", "Cheri", "Daniele"]
students_period_B = ["Dora", "Minerva", "Alexa", "Obie"]

for student in students_period_A:
  #students_period_A.append(student)  this line initiates an infinite loop
  print(student)

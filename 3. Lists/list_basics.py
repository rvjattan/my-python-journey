# A list is one of the basic data structures in Python that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order

#Suppose we want to make a list of the heights of students in a class:

# Noelle is 61 inches tall
# Ava is 70 inches tall
# Sam is 67 inches tall
# Mia is 64 inches tall

# we can create a list like: 

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]


# A list can contain any data type in Python:
mixed_list_common = ["Mia", 27, False, 0.5]

# We can also create an empty list:
my_list = []

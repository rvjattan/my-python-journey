    # If [it is raining], then [bring an umbrella]

  print("apple")    # will print apple as the equation evaluates to true

# Example :

#if the username is Dave / Ryan, it tells him to stay off the computer

user_name = "Ryan" # it can be any name

if user_name == "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")

# another if statement

if user_name == "Ryan":
  print("Get off my PC Ryan")

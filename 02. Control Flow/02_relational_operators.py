# first relational operator (==) return True if both its operands are the same otherwise False
# second relational operator (!=) return False if statement is True and return True if the statement is False

1 == 1     # Evaluates to True as the operands are the same 

1 != 1     # Evaluates to False as the operands are the same 

2 != 4     # Evaluates to True as the operands are different 

3 == 5     # Evaluates to False as the operands are different
 
'7' == 7   # Evaluates to False as the operands are different types 


# example

2 * 2 == 2 + 2 # True

3 + 3 != 3 * 3  # True

3 * 3 == '9' # False
